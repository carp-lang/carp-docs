## Multimedia Libraries

The Carp compiler comes bundled with bindings for a few common games/multimedia libraries.

For installation instructions, see [Install.md](Install.md).

### SDL

You can find the API documentation for the SDL bindings [here](http://carp-lang.github.io/carp-docs/sdl/SDL_index.html).
Many of the [examples](../examples) use these bindings -- check them out!

## OpenGL
